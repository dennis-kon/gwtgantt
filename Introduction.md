## About ##

gwt-gantt is a web-based Gantt Chart component similar to what you see in Microsoft Project. It is built in pure Java / GWT and can be easily integrated into any GWT application.

gwt-gannt was built after many lessons learned creating and maintaining the [gwt-cal](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-cal/) widget library. We hope to make gwt-gantt a simple, **easily customizable** widget library.

## Features ##

  * Gantt Chart widget with Week/Month/Quarter/Year views
  * Tree table for displaying, expanding and collapsing Tasks (Experimental)
  * Uses GWT 2.1's Data Presentation model for data binding
  * Uses Deferred Binding allowing easy class substitution, customization

## Roadmap ##

  * Include a Half-Day view in the Gantt Chart
  * Include an Hour view in the Gantt Chart
  * Improve rendering performance by using GWT 2.1's SafeHTMLBuilder
