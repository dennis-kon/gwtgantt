**gwt-gantt** is a web-based Gantt Chart widget for use in Google Web Toolkit (GWT) applications. Features include:
  * Gantt Chart with Hour/Day/Week/Month/Quarter views
  * Compatible with GWT 2.1 Data Presentation model
  * Pure Java with GWT, not a JS wrapper

gwt-gantt is in its early stages, and currently only works with HTML5 capable webapps that support inline SVG components (Firefox 4 and Chrome 6+). Support for non-HTML5 webapps will be coming soon, but is a lower priority.

You can see gwt-gantt in action at the  [Chrome App Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kdecagaipaomhgmddggocgibjclimaol). The gwt-gantt chart is a core component of the Multitask project management application (picture below).
